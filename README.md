## Installation

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com).

Follow the steps to get [faf-db](https://github.com/FAForever/db) setup, the following assumes the db container is called `faf-db` and the database is called `faf` and the root password is `banana`.


The server needs an RSA key to decode uniqueid messages, we've provided an example key in the repo as `faf-server.example.pem`. The server expects this to be named `faf-server.pem` at runtime, so first copy this

    cp faf-server.example.pem faf-server.pem

Then use Docker to build and run the server as follows

    docker build -t faf-server .
    docker run --link faf-db:db -p 8001:8001 -p 30351:30351 faf-server

Check if the container is running with

    docker ps

If you cannot find `faf-server` in the list, run `docker run` without `-d` to see what happens.

If you have a different root password, database name then the default (see [config.py](https://github.com/FAForever/server/blob/develop/server/config.py#L43)), you must pass it over the environment parameter of docker, e.g.

    docker run --link faf-db:db -p 8001:8001 -p 30351:30351 -e FAF_DB_PASSWORD=<wanted_password> -e FAF_DB_NAME=<db_name> faf-server

# Contributing

To contribute, please fork this repository and make pull requests to the develop branch.

Use the normal git conventions for commit messages, with the following rules:
 - Subject line shorter than 80 characters
 - Proper capitalized sentence as subject line, with no trailing period
 - For non-trivial commits, always include a commit message body, describing the change in detail
 - If there are related issues, reference them in the commit message footer

## Setting up for development

First make sure you have an instance of `faf-db` running as described in the
installation section. Then install the dependencies to a virtual environment
using pipenv:

    $ pipenv install --dev

You can start the server in development mode with:

    $ pipenv run devserver

**Note** *The pipenv scripts are not meant for production deployment. For
deployment use `faf-stack`*

## Running the tests

Some of the tests require the database to be pre-populated with test data. Download
the latest `test-data.sql` from [FAForever/db](https://github.com/FAForever/db
into the root of this project, then run:

    $ pipenv run tests

## Other tools

You can check for possible unused code with `vulture` by running:

    $ pipenv run vulture

# License

GPLv3. See the [license](license.txt) file.

# Network Protocol

The protocol is mainly JSON-encoded maps, containing at minimum a `command` key, representing the command to dispatch.

The wire format uses [QDataStream](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdatastream.html) (UTF-16, BigEndian).

For the lobbyconnection, each message is of the form:

    ACTION: QString

With most carrying a footer containing:

    LOGIN: QString
    SESSION: QString
