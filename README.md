## Installation

Install [docker](https://www.docker.com).

Follow the steps to get [faf-db](https://github.com/FAForever/db) setup, the following assumes the db container is called `faf-db` and the database is called `faf` and the root password ist `banana`.


The server needs an RSA key to decode uniqueid messages, we've provided an example key in the repo as `faf-server.example.pem`. The server expects this to be named `faf-server.pem` at runtime, so first copy this

    cp faf-server.example.pem faf-server.pem

Then use Docker to build and run the server as follows

    docker build -t faf-server .
    docker run --link faf-db:db -p 8001:8001 -p 30351:30351 faf-server

Check if the container is running with

    docker ps

If you cannot find `faf-server`in the list, run `docker run` without `-d` to see what happen.

If you have a different root password, database name then the default (see [config.py](https://github.com/FAForever/server/blob/develop/server/config.py#L43)), you must pass it over the environment parameter of docker, e.g.

    docker run --link faf-db:db -p 8001:8001 -p 30351:30351 -e FAF_DB_PASSWORD=<wanted_password> -e FAF_DB_NAME=<db_name> faf-server 
   
## Running the tests

Run `py.test`

    docker run --link faf-db:db faf-server bash -c py.test

# Network Protocol

The protocol is mainly JSON-encoded maps, containing at minimum a `command` key, representing the command to dispatch.

The wire format uses [QDataStream](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qdatastream.html) (UTF-16, BigEndian).

For the lobbyconnection, each message is of the form:

    ACTION: QString

With most carrying a footer containing:

    LOGIN: QString
    SESSION: QString

With a few message-types (`UPLOAD_MOD`, `UPLOAD_MAP`), there are more fields.
